## Disadvantage in Limitations
### In INFO.txt
- Have you seen the askterisk in features? You can get your victim's location etc... But there is a limitation. (Those who have askterisk) Please make sure your victim have termux api app.
- In termux api. Reading Sms is no longer permitted by google play. (double askterisk)

### In File Stealer
- Useless files like any dot files (.files), cache will be included. Sadly I don't know how to fix this.
- Everything depends on your victim's internet connection. 
- If your victim is smart enough. Your victim will know. Well it depends. I have put "--disable previews" and I don't know how to fix the others.
